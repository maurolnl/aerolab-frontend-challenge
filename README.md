# Aerolab Frontend Developer coding challenge

The challenge is to build a catalog view for a loyalty program app. Weâ€™ll provide you with the base UI and API, you can use it as provided or you can make any improvements you deem fit. Itâ€™s up to you, your imagination and your skills to come up with new solutions and/or interactions between the components.

Remember that the productâ€™s main goal is to help users redeem items through a points-based system. We expect your end-product to be both visually attractive and functionally effective.

## Description

I tried to build the challenge to meet all the levels of the Acceptance Criteria. At first it was kinda challenging because of the extension and the details in the Figma (btw great work by them), but then when I got used to it and set the design system it was full throttle. I ended up learning a lot of things I'm glad I gave it a shot.

### Tech Stack
- **NextJS** and **SWR** for fetching the data from the server on the client side, which helped me to keep updated in real time the AeroCoins when a product is redeem.
- I opted to use **Styled Component** because it was a good chance to learn it and challenge my self ðŸ’ª.
- **Framer Motion** for the animations.
- **React Select** for the custom select present in the Figma.
- **React Hot Toast** for the notifications.
- **TypeScript**.
- **Jest** + **React Testing Library** for the tests.

It was really fun to build and I was really inspired by all the details and effort that the Aerolab team put into it.
